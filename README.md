# E-Commerce Project for React JS

This work was make by Trinidad Margni for the course of React JS Development in CoderHouse. It's an ecommerce, where you can simulate buying "mystery boxes", this mystery boxes are oriented to the bookish community, with different authors and famous books as the principal topic of each one. Also, you have different "categories" and "subscriptions". You can simulate a process of buying but it doesn't has a payment system or a form to create an user.
